    "\n",
    "Market Indicators are numeric values assigned to particular aspect of the market performance, for example:\n",
    "- \"S&P 500\" index show how major stocks as a whole are performing\n",
    "- \"ISM Manufacturing\" index shows how well the manufacturing industry is doing\n",
    "- \"GDP\" index (Gross Domestic Product) shows how the country is doing\n",
    "- etc., etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds, if not thousands, of such indicators."

    "\n",
    "1. The primary goal of the project is to **gather and analyze** various market indicators.\n",
    "2. The secondary goal is to predict market trends 30 to 90 days ahead. \n",
    "3. The tertiary goal is to predict a particular stock price based on the market indicators.\n",
    "4. Additionally, the goal will be to maintain a stock portfolio including diversification using \"hedge fund\" principles.\n",
    "5. Finally, it is my goal to document the process."

    "### AI\n",
    "The advantage of machine learning, or Artificial Intelligence (AI), is when that we have thousands of possible indicators, the human brain fails to grasp the wealth of the information presented. \n",

    "The machine learning, on the other hand can easily detect the patterns in thousands of datapoints and derive a conclussion."

    "- it is designed for scientific computing and machine learning\n",
